## Polls project form ui.dev

This project is very similar to the Polls project of the [Redux course of ui.dev](https://ui.dev/redux), because both courses were created by the same instructor.

The main differences are that Polls doesn't have a login page to choose the user (the authenticated user is hardcoded), and each poll has 4 different answers instead of 2.
